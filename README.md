# Stock-Analysis

## **Overview of Project**

### To assist Steve to analyze the dataset of the entire stock market over the last few years, with utilizing a refactored code based on the original solution code.

## **Results**

### **Stock Performance between 2017 and 2018**

  _1. Upon comparing the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, we can see that all the stocks had a negative return on 2018, except for ENPH and RUN._

  _2. ENPH contiunued to retain a positive return rate in 2018, which was relatively lower than 2017._

  _3. RUN outperfomred the other stocks in 2018, with an approximaetly 78.5% increase in return compared with 2017._

  _4. TERP continued to underperform in 2018, with a 5% loss in return; however, the loss was relatively smaller than 2017._

### **Execution Time Comparison between the Original Script and the Refactored Script**

  _1. For the year 2017, the execution time of the orginal script is about 0.796875 seconds. With the refactored script, the execution time can be shortened to 0.1289063 seconds, approximately 6 times faster than the original script._

## **Summary**

- **What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general?**

  - _Advantages of Refactoring Code:_

    - _1. Improve the design of software._

    - _2. Simplify the code and make it easier to understand._

    - _3. Help the developer find bugs._

    - _4. Enhance the efficiency and help programming faster._ 
  
  - _Disavantages of Refactoring Code:_

    - _1. Refactoring code is very time consuming._

    - _2. There is a chance of creating bugs/errors during refactoring process._

    - _3. It is risky when the existing code doesn't have a comprehensive data set for a test, which will lead to a situation that the deveoper has no clue how to fix the new bugs/errors._
